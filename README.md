# A guide to installing VSCode and Git Bash
I have noticed several other students who want to use VSCode but have refrained from doing so because using it is difficult on Windows or because it is difficult to use while connected to the Hydra or Tesla machines.
This guide is intended for those people.


## Contents
Here are the sections to this guide:
1. Install [VSCode]()
2. Install [Git Bash]()
3. Set Git Bash as the default terminal in VSCode
4. Learn the basics of VSCode and some keyboard shortcuts
5. Learn how to quickly move files between your machine and the Hydra/Tesla machines

This guide will eventually be preceded/appended with a list of useful commands for quick reference.
